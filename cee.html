  options:["A) doubled","B) four times","C) halved","D) unchanged"], 
  answer:"B",

{ question: "Work done by the centripetal force on a body in uniform circular motion over one complete revolution is",
  options: ["A) positive", "B) negative", "C) zero", "D) depends on speed"],
  answer: "C",
  explanation: {
    "A": "Incorrect. Centripetal force is always perpendicular to instantaneous displacement, so it does no positive work.",
    "B": "Incorrect. It does no negative work either for the same perpendicular reason.",
    "C": "Correct. Because force is perpendicular to displacement at every instant, total work over a closed path = 0.",

  options: ["A) +W", "B) −W", "C) zero", "D) depends on potential energy"],
  answer: "B",
  explanation: {
    "A": "Incorrect. If friction removes energy (−W work), mechanical energy decreases by W, not increases.",
    "B": "Correct. Non-conservative work equals change in mechanical energy: ΔE_mech = W_nc = −W.",
    "C": "Incorrect. Only zero if W = 0 (no friction).",

    "A": "Incorrect. KE_rot = 1/2 I ω² — depends on I also.",
    "B": "Incorrect. Moment of inertia alone does not set energy without ω.",

  explanation: {
    "A": "Correct. Low Re → laminar flow; high Re → turbulent flow (general criterion).",
